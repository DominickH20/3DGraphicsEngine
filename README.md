# 3DGraphicsEngine
This project implements a fully functional 3D graphics display methodology, built on the mathematics behind vector projection. Information
on how this project works can be found in the MathematicalFoundation.pdf document. Currently, it's most robust capabilities allow for
display of vector valued functions or Surfaces in R3. However, rigid shapes like cubes or lattices can be coded up for display as well.

### Usage   
To use this project, run the EngineHost.py file

Use the `w`,`a`,`s`,`d` keys to rotate the camera  
Press `q` anytime to quit the program  
Use the `z`,`x` keys to zoom the camera in and out  
Use the `i`,`j`,`k`,`l` keys to traverse left, right, up, and down  

Note that currently, only the start up visualizations have been implemented, however, users are free to develop and render their own objects
in the meantime while a more sophisticated rendering system is implemented
