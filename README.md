# 3DGraphicsEngine
This project aims to produce a fully functional 3-dimensional graphics engine using a backbone of vector projection.

Elements of this project will include:

-development of a core library to deal in 3 dimensional vector operations

-development of an engine to display vector defined points

  -stage 1: fix x,y,z axes and produce projections

  -stage 2: allow rotation about the z axis - live updates for the image

  -stage 3: allow rotation and revolution in all directions

  -stage 4: logic for shading and depth
