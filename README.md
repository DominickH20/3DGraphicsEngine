# 3DGraphicsEngine
This goal of this project is to produce a fully functional 3-dimensional graphics engine using a mathematical backbone of vector projection.

To use this project, run the EngineHost.py file. Note that at the moment, only one visualization can be viewed. More options will be added in the future.
